It somewhat makes you think of the feeling of finding an unknown file thrown into some directory you've never accessed before, like when you explore someone else's flash drive, or that night you stayed up late playing at your cousin's PC and out of boredom began looking around their files."}},{"id":"PEAgwqM-mk","type":"embed","data":{"service":"twitter","source":"https://twitter.com/chibikki_ikki/status/1525636732741644288","embed":"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/chibikki_ikki/status/1525636732741644288","width":600,"height":300,"caption":"@chibikki_ikki on Twitter has a bunch of art like this"}},{"id":"p6mhbS6kTR","type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"⠀Of course there's also music, and to be completely honest, I haven't quite figured out what's so particular about certain specific songs that make me think about millennium era sound design, but I can name some artists. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/65XcfOOaVxbZnNlz40DK7i?si=wY5G9YP6TNCp5c4rGmtmcA\">Windows 96</a> is a great brazilian composer and producer I've never let go of since I found him, and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5VpwooBxeX1pUlDI9oj2Mf?si=9eJDoKd8TTm36adIiMPdbw\">Dera Palné</a>'s album <i>\"uwu safe zone\"</i> became sort of like <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3Qsc0NMqQsOpEVqi1Htiyl?si=df5a5e7465c44f15\">The Sims Buy Menu</a> music for me, in the sense I use it to concentrate on anything I'm working, like it's part of my irl soundtrack.
