<article><p>Most notably, I run my own personal brand "Norrum Plexus", whose name began as my nickname, yet it came to represent the totality of my internet presence as a network for all my work pieces and content; my <a href="http://plexos.neocities.org/entries/blog1.html#metaplexus">meta plexus</a>.<br></p>

	<p>I run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NorrumPlexus">Youtube Channel</a> with the same name, though video production is way too time consuming to keep up with everything I do through vlogs, so I mostly use it to upload short heavily edited game-related videos and montages as a hobby.</p>

	<p>Sometimes I do digital art, mostly pixelart drawings, usually as gifts for my friends, and almost all of it is on my <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/norrum">DeviantArt</a>. It is strictly a hobby, so I never took commissions and I don't think I ever will, so... I'm sorry if you like my work <i>that</i> much lmao.</p>

	<p>Lastly, I love videogames, of course. Resident Evil is the only thing in the world I consider myself a true fan of, though I also love the Metal Gear and Yakuza series, and also games that allow me to build stuff, like Rollercoaster Tycoon, The Sims and Minecraft.</p>

	<p>I'm very fond of the PC adventure game genre, specially with its resurgence through the independent scene, and games like Kentucky Route Zero, Firewatch and Oxenfree, as well as narrative experiences in general like Disco Elysium and Her Story.</p>

	<p>And then, I'm a really good CS:GO player, been to global; I'm also good defending my FOBs in MGSV and I main Huntress and Jill in DBD. I'd love to get into more fighting games, yet for now I can hold my own with Xiaoyu in Tekken, and sometimes combo with Cerebella in Skullgirls.</p>
